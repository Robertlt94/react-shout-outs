# React Shout Outs Assignment
Due: Beginning of class 5/8/24

## Introduction
React Shout Outs is a simple single-page application built with create-react-app that allows users to make announcements. Users can input a message, their name, and the date of the announcement, which will then be displayed at the top of the page as the latest announcement. This application serves as a coding assignment to understand basic React development and Git branching strategies.

## Assignment Requirements
App Functionality
The application must have an input form with three fields:
----------------------------------------------
A text box for the announcement message.
A text box for the user's name.
An input for the date, using a date picker component.
----------------------------------------------
The latest announcement should be displayed at the top of the page above the form.
The page should update immediately when a new announcement is posted, displaying the most recent announcement prominently.

## Branching and Styling
The Git repository for this project should have at least two feature branches apart from the main branch.

### Feature Branch 1: This branch will contain a specific set of CSS styles that are different from the main and the second feature branch.

### Feature Branch 2: This branch will have a distinctly different set of CSS styles compared to the main and the first feature branch.

### Main Branch: This should have a combination of styles from both feature branches and should be considered the production branch.

Each branch should significantly alter the appearance of the UI when checked out (git checkout [branch-name]).

## Deliverables
A working React application meeting the functionality requirements:
A Git repository with at least three branches 

### main
### feature branch 1
### feature branch 2

with the appropriate styles implemented in each branch.
